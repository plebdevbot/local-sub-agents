[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'password_generator.py' with:
- A function generate_password(length=16) using secrets module
- Main block that prints 3 passwords

Use run_command: python password_generator.py

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a password generator script that uses Python's secrets module to generate secure passwords, so I'll write a file named password_generator.py with a function generate_password that takes a length parameter and uses secrets.SystemRandom to produce random characters from a set of letters, digits, and symbols. I'll include a main block that prints three generated passwords. After writing the file, I'll execute it using run_command to verify it works, then call task_complete with a summary confirming the script was created and tested.
