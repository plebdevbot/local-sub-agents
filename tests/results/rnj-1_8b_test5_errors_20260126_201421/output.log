[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools.

Use read_file to try reading 'nonexistent.txt' - it will fail.
Then use write_file to create 'error_log.txt' with a message about the missing file.

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to handle the error from your request by first attempting to read 'nonexistent.txt', which will fail since the file doesn't exist. I then create 'error_log.txt' with a clear message explaining the missing file, ensuring the issue is documented. Finally, I complete the task by summarizing the outcome, confirming the error was logged as intended.
