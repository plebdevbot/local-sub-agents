[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'docker-compose.yml' with:
- nginx service on port 80
- postgres service with POSTGRES_PASSWORD env var
- redis service on port 6379
- All on network 'app-net'

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a docker-compose.yml file with four services: nginx, postgres, and redis, all on the same network 'app-net'. I'll structure the file with version 3.9, define each service with their respective image, environment variables—setting POSTGRES_PASSWORD for postgres, expose ports 80 for nginx and 6379 for redis, and ensure all services are on the 'app-net' network. After writing the file, I'll call task_complete with a summary confirming the file was created successfully.
