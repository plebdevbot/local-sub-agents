[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT guess or make up data.

1. Use read_file to read 'scores.json' FIRST - it contains the actual data
2. Parse the JSON and calculate the real average from the scores in the file
3. Use write_file to create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average
4. Use run_command: cat report.txt

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to read the 'scores.json' file to access the data, so I'll start by using read_file to get its contents. Once I have the JSON, I'll parse it to extract each person's name and score, then calculate the average by summing the scores and dividing by the count. With the average computed, I'll create a 'report.txt' file where each line contains a person's name and their score, followed by the calculated average. After writing the report, I'll use run_command to display its contents with cat, and finally call task_complete to confirm the task is done.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to calculate the average score from the data in scores.json, which contains three entries: Alice (85), Bob (92), and Carol (78). Adding those gives 255, and dividing by 3 results in 85.0. I then create a report.txt file where each person's name and score are listed, followed by the average. After writing this content, I use run_command to display the file's contents with cat, and finally call task_complete to confirm the task is finished.
