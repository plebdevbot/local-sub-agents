[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'password_generator.py' with:
- A function generate_password(length=16) using secrets module
- Main block that prints 3 passwords

Use run_command: python password_generator.py

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a password generator script that uses Python's secrets module to generate secure passwords, so I'll write a file named password_generator.py with a function generate_password(length=16) that uses secrets.token_hex to ensure cryptographic randomness. I'll include a main block that prints three generated passwords by calling this function three times. After writing the file, I'll execute it using run_command to verify it works, and once confirmed, I'll call task_complete with a summary confirming the script was created and tested successfully.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I created a secure password generator using Python's secrets module by writing a script that generates passwords of a specified length, tested it by running the script to produce three sample passwords, and confirmed the task was completed successfully, so I’m now letting you know the task is done and offering help if you need anything else.

RESPONSE: The task is complete! The password generator script has been created and tested successfully. Here's a summary:

- Created `password_generator.py` using Python's `secrets` module for secure password generation
- Tested the script to generate 3 sample passwords
- All commands executed successfully

Would you like me to help with anything else?
