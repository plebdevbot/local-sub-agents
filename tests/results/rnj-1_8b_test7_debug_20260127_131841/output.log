[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Follow these steps IN ORDER:

STEP 1: run_command with 'python calculator.py' - you will see a NameError
STEP 2: read_file 'calculator.py' to see the code
STEP 3: The bug is using 'count' instead of 'len(numbers)' - fix it with write_file
STEP 4: run_command 'python calculator.py' again to verify the fix works

Call task_complete when the script runs successfully.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to fix the calculator.py script that's throwing a NameError. First, I'll run the script to confirm the error occurs. Then I'll inspect the file to see the problematic code. I notice the issue is using 'count' instead of 'len(numbers)', so I'll correct that line. After updating the file, I'll run the script again to verify the fix works. Once it runs successfully, I'll complete the task.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I see the error is a NameError because 'count' is used but not defined—this happens because the code uses 'count' instead of 'len(numbers)'. I need to fix the calculate_average function by replacing 'count' with 'len(numbers)' in calculator.py. I'll edit the file to make this change, then run the script again to verify the fix works. Once it runs successfully, I'll complete the task.
