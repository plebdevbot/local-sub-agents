[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools.

1. Use read_file to read 'scores.json' (JSON array with name/score objects)
2. Use write_file to create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average at bottom
3. Use run_command: cat report.txt

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[agent][0m Iteration 1/10
[0;34m[model][0m  To complete the task, here is a step-by-step plan using the provided functions:

1. Read `scores.json` file using the `read_file` function and store its contents. Let's assume the variable name for the stored content is `data`.

2. Loop through the JSON array and extract names and scores of each person. Calculate and store the average score in a variable.

3. Write the extracted data to `report.txt` using the `write_file` function. The format should be "Name: Score
" for each person and "Average: AverageScore
" at the bottom.

4. Run the command `cat report.txt` to display the contents of `report.txt` in the console using the `run_command` function.

5. After completing all the steps, call `task_complete` with a summary like "Generated report for scores with average score."
