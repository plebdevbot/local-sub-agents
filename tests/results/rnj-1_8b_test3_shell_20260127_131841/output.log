[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'sysinfo.sh' that shows:
- hostname and kernel version
- disk usage for /
- top 3 memory processes

Use run_command: chmod +x sysinfo.sh
Use run_command: ./sysinfo.sh

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a script called sysinfo.sh that displays the hostname, kernel version, disk usage for the root directory, and the top 3 memory-consuming processes. I'll write this script using the write_file tool, ensuring it includes the necessary commands: hostname, uname, df, and ps with sorting and limiting to the top 3 processes. After creating the script, I'll make it executable using chmod +x and then execute it with ./sysinfo.sh to generate the output. Once the script runs successfully, I'll complete the task by summarizing what was accomplished.
