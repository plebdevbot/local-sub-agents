Use write_file to create 'password_generator.py' with:
- A function generate_password(length=16) using secrets module
- Main block that prints 3 passwords

Use run_command: python password_generator.py

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a Python script that generates secure passwords using the secrets module, so I'll write a file named password_generator.py with a function generate_password that takes a length parameter and uses secrets.SystemRandom to produce cryptographically secure passwords. I'll include a main block that prints three example passwords. After writing the file, I'll execute it using run_command to verify it works, then call task_complete to confirm the task is finished.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I created a secure password generator by writing a Python script that uses the secrets module to generate cryptographically strong passwords, tested it by running the script to ensure it outputs three random passwords, and confirmed the task was completed successfully.

The password generator script was created and tested successfully. It generates secure passwords using the secrets module, and the test run produced three random passwords as expected. The task is complete.
