[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Follow these steps IN ORDER:

STEP 1: run_command with 'python calculator.py' - you will see a NameError
STEP 2: read_file 'calculator.py' to see the code
STEP 3: The bug is using 'count' instead of 'len(numbers)' - fix it with write_file
STEP 4: run_command 'python calculator.py' again to verify the fix works

Call task_complete when the script runs successfully.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to fix the calculator.py script that's throwing a NameError. First, I'll run the script to confirm the error occurs. Then I'll read the file to inspect the code and identify the issue. I notice the code uses 'count' which is undefined, but the intended behavior is to calculate the length of the numbers list. I'll modify the code to use len(numbers) instead. After updating the file, I'll run the script again to verify the fix works. Once it runs successfully, I'll complete the task.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I see the error occurs because 'count' is undefined in calculate_average, so I need to fix the code by replacing 'count' with len(numbers) in calculator.py. I'll read the file to confirm the current code, then update it to use len(numbers) instead of count. After making the change, I'll run the script again to verify the fix works.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I fixed the NameError in your calculator.py script by replacing the undefined 'count' variable with len( numbers) in the calculate_average function, which correctly calculates the average. I verified the fix by running the script successfully, and now the task is complete.

The issue was that the original code used an undefined variable 'count', causing a NameError. I corrected this by replacing 'count' with len( numbers), which properly calculates the number of elements in the list. After making this change, I ran the script again and confirmed it executed without errors, producing the correct output. The fix is now complete and working as intended.
