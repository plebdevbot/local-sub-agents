[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools.

1. Use run_command: node main.js (it will show a bug - the year shows as literal 'YYYY')
2. Use read_file to examine both 'utils.js' and 'main.js'
3. Find and fix the bug in utils.js using write_file
4. Use run_command: node main.js (should now show correct year like 2026)

Call task_complete with what you fixed.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I first run the main.js script to observe the bug where the year appears as the literal 'YYYY'. I then examine both utils.js and main.js to identify the root cause, focusing on how the current year is being retrieved. I find that the issue lies in utils.js where the year is hardcoded as a string 'YYYY' instead of being dynamically obtained. I correct this by modifying the code to use the actual current year via new Date().getFullYear(). After updating utils.js, I re-run main.js to verify the fix, confirming the year now displays correctly, and finally complete the task with a summary of the fix.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I see the issue: the year is hardcoded as 'YYYY' in the output, so I need to fix the date formatting in utils.js. I'll read both utils.js and main.js to locate where the year is being set. Once I identify the hardcoded value, I'll replace 'YYYY' with the actual current year using new Date().getFullYear(). After updating utils.js, I'll run main.js again to verify the fix, then complete the task with a summary of the changes made.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I see the issue: the formatDate function in utils.js is returning 'YYYY-' instead of the actual year because it's using a hardcoded string. I need to fix this by replacing 'YYYY-' with the actual year from the date object. I'll update the return statement to use date.getFullYear() so it dynamically pulls the correct year. After making this change, I'll run main.js again to verify the output now shows the correct year instead of 'YYYY'.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I fixed the bug in utils.js by replacing the hardcoded 'YYYY' with the actual year using date. getFullYear(), ensuring the year now displays correctly. I verified the fix by running the script again, confirming the output shows the correct year. The issue is resolved, and I’m ready to provide further help if needed.
