[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools.

1. Use read_file to read 'scores.json' (JSON array with name/score objects)
2. Use write_file to create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average at bottom
3. Use run_command: cat report.txt

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to read the 'scores.json' file to access the name-score data, then calculate the average score by summing all scores and dividing by the count. I'll format each person's name and score into a readable string, append the average at the bottom, and write this to 'report.txt'. After writing the file, I'll display its contents using 'cat report.txt' to verify the output, and finally confirm completion with a summary of the task.
