[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'docker-compose.yml' with:
- nginx service on port 80
- postgres service with POSTGRES_PASSWORD env var
- redis service on port 6379
- All on network 'app-net'

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a docker-compose.yml file with four services: nginx, postgres, and redis, all on the app-net network. I'll structure the file with version 3.9, define each service with their respective configurations—nginx on port 80, postgres with POSTGRES_PASSWORD, redis on port 6379, and the network declaration. I'll use the write_file tool to generate the file and then call task_complete to confirm completion.
