[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools. Do NOT output code as text.

Use write_file to create 'sysinfo.sh' that shows:
- hostname and kernel version
- disk usage for /
- top 3 memory processes

Use run_command: chmod +x sysinfo.sh
Use run_command: ./sysinfo.sh

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m THOUGHT: I need to create a script that gathers system information, so I'll write a shell script that checks the hostname and kernel version, disk usage for the root directory, and the top three memory-consuming processes. I'll save this script as sysinfo.sh, make it executable, and then run it to generate the output. Once the script executes, I'll compile the results into a summary to complete the task.
