[0;34m[agent][0m Task: You MUST use tools.

1. Use read_file to read 'scores.json' (JSON array with name/score objects)
2. Use write_file to create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average at bottom
3. Use run_command: cat report.txt

Call task_complete with summary.

[0;34m[model][0m To solve the issue, we need to ensure that 'report.txt' is created before trying to run it.

```python
from json_tool import read_file, write_file, run_command, task_complete

# Read JSON array from scores.json file
scores = read_file('scores.json')

# Initialize sum of scores and count of students
total_score = 0
student_count = 0

# Calculate average score
for student in scores:
    total_score += student['score']
    student_count += 1

average_score = total_score / student_count

# Create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average at bottom
write_file('report.txt', '
'.join(f'{student["name"]}:{student["score"]}' for student in scores) + f'
Average score: {average_score}')

# Run command to print report.txt
run_command('cat report.txt')

# Report completion with summary
task_complete(summary=f'Report created successfully. Average score: {average_score}')
```

This code will create 'report.txt' first, then run the command to print it.

Final response:
To solve the issue, we need to ensure that 'report.txt' is created before trying to run it.

```python
from json_tool import read_file, write_file, run_command, task_complete

# Read JSON array from scores.json file
scores = read_file('scores.json')

# Initialize sum of scores and count of students
total_score = 0
student_count = 0

# Calculate average score
for student in scores:
    total_score += student['score']
    student_count += 1

average_score = total_score / student_count

# Create 'report.txt' with each person's name:score and the average at bottom
write_file('report.txt', '\n'.join(f'{student["name"]}:{student["score"]}' for student in scores) + f'\nAverage score: {average_score}')

# Run command to print report.txt
run_command('cat report.txt')

# Report completion with summary
task_complete(summary=f'Report created successfully. Average score: {average_score}')
```

This code will create 'report.txt' first, then run the command to print it.
